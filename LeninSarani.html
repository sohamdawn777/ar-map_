    <h1>Echoes of Revolution on the Wall</h1>
    <p>Walking along Lenin Sarani is like stepping into a living chronicle of Kolkata’s political and cultural history. Named after the Russian revolutionary, the street carries an air of old-world activism, once echoing with passionate debates and marches during the early 20th century. The graffiti here is more than mere decoration—it is a visual diary. Walls are adorned with bold reds, black silhouettes, and dynamic figures reminiscent of revolutionary posters, blending Marxist symbols with the modern struggles of the city. Artists juxtapose historic figures with contemporary calls for social justice, turning concrete into canvases of resistance. Each mural narrates a story: the struggle for equality, workers’ rights, and the ongoing fight for voice and visibility in the sprawling metropolis. Here, Lenin Sarani’s graffiti doesn’t just color the walls—it energizes them with the heartbeat of revolutionary spirit.</p>
