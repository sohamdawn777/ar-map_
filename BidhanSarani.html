    <h1>The Scholar's Wall</h1>
    <p>Bidhan Sarani, named after the first Chief Minister of West Bengal, is lined with educational institutions and historic homes that have seen generations pass. Graffiti along this street often carries intellectual undertonesâ€”quotes from poets, abstract depictions of knowledge and learning, and socially conscious imagery. One mural combines Bengali literary legends with contemporary calls for education and awareness, bridging past and present. Historically, this area was a hub for intellectual discourse, and its walls now mirror that tradition. Artists here use color and symbolism to narrate stories of Kolkata as a city of thinkers, writers, and dreamers, giving the street an almost literary aura.</p>
